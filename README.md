# firebaseAuthApp
 This is a modern React app that uses Firebase Authentication to allow users to register, log in, and log out.
The app will have protected routes — meaning only logged in users can see certain pages.

⚙️ Technologies we use:

* ⚛️ React (Vite) — frontend framework

* 🔥 Firebase Authentication — backend service for login/registration

* 🧭 React Router — for navigating between pages

* 🎨 CSS / Tailwind (optional) — for styling

* 🧠 React Hooks — for state and context (useState, useEffect, createContext)
